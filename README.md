 # Sharp Resolver / Slingshot
Product Name: Sharp Resolver  
Team Name: Slingshot


## Description 
 * This product is designed to pinpoint sharp objects on the ground on a map. When someone finds a sharp object on the ground, he or she can drop a pin on the map and voluntarily include comments or pictures. Then any eligible person can see all of the outstanding sharp objects and can solve any existing pins on the map. 
 * The problem we are trying to solve is that there are a lot of sharp objects on the ground that are harmful to the people around that area. Then when people see a sharp object, the only way they could do is to email the local community center or the City of Toronto. When the community center or the City of Toronto received the email, the needles are probably long gone. It is also for any staff members to go to the field and find the sharp objects just simply by an email description. 
 * This application will display all the existing unresolved needles and eligible people can go there and pick the needles up then resolved the needles on the application. It will make pinpointing needles and resolving needles a lot faster and more efficient.
